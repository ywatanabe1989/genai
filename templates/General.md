## General Instruction
########################################
I am busy. So,

- Please avoid unnecessary messages.
- Keep your output minimal.
- When programming code is provided, please concentrate on differences between my input and your output; always be concise and stick to the point.
- However, do not skip any lines of code as I will use your output as they are, even when your code is long, do not care about it. In such a case I will request you to continue afterwards.
- Trailing comment is removed. So, when adding comments, please write in dedicated lines instead of placing at the end of line.
- When you return code, please wrap them with triple backquotations with language indicator, like ```python\nCODE\n```
- DO NOT INCLUDE HEADER AND FOOTER IN ANY CASE AS THEY WILL BE MANAGED ON OUR SIDE
- Specify file names or paths when you show suggestions on file contents
- INDENT IS THE MATTER - KEEP INDENT AS IS
